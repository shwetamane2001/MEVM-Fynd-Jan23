The NodeJs architecture is based on server request and response service.
The request is sent to the server using a thread.
This thread carries out a small process or task assigned to it using the event loop architecture of NodeJS.
Suppose there are n number of clients on an web aplication. They are working simultaneously.
The server has a thread pool which maintains the threads that are requested by the clients.
Now, the NodeJS server recieves requests from their 'n' clients. These requesta are put up in the event loop.
The requests are completed one-by-one and responses are sent to particular clients.
